My [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com) solutions. Spoilers abound - don't look until you're done.

I really just repo this up so I can work from any of my various computers.
If you happen to find some value in my solutions then that's a bonus.

I'd love to say that there is substantial educational value in my solutions. Maybe
there is at least something there. I can promise that they work; I can't promise that
they are the best, the fastest, the cleanest, etc. None of that is part of the game
for me, I'm in this to sharpen my skills a bit.
